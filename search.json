Do not put excess pressure on or crush the hydrophone**\n\nRemove hydrophone, preamplifier, and Handy Recorder from box\nConnect the hydrophone to the preamplifier by plugging the yellow labeled end of the hydrophone to the preamplifier box and twist the hydrophone cable to lock them together \nConnect the other end of the preamplifier to the Handy Recorder, align three pins from preamplifier to the channel 1 recorder port, and click into place\nTurn on Handy Recorder using power button on the left side, and ensure the four channel (4CH) recording option is selected at the top (see help steps below in Recording Only With One Hydrophone (Single-Channel Recording))\n\nPress the record button once and lightly tap on each of the two attached microphones on top of the recorder, as well as the hydrophone\nCheck for signal changes on the recorder screen\n\nEach of the three recording bars (MIC L & R, IN 1) should be moving and the record button should be blinking red\nIf there is no signal change for the hydrophone, follow steps in Recorder Not Displaying Signal Change From Hydrophone section\nIf testing hydrophone in water, ensure only the end of the hydrophone is in the water, and no other components, including the preamplifier and recorder, get wet\n\n\nOnce both microphones and the hydrophone has been tested, press the stop button and turn off the recorder\nCarefully remove the preamplifier/hydrophone cable from the recorder (press metal tab on back of recorder port while pulling the cable)\nUntwist the hydrophone, pull cable from preamplifier, and return all components to hydrophone and recorder cases\n\n\n\nSetting Up and Changing Settings for Handy Recorder\n\nLoading an SD Card\nAn SD card is required to record and save on the Handy Recorder\n\nMake sure recorder power is off\nInsert SD card into slot on right side of the recorder\n\nCautions\n\nSD card must be 16MB to 32GB\nIf “Format Card” appears on the display startup, the SD card must be formatted for the device. Press DIAL and select YES to format the SD card for the H4n Pro\nClear SD card before recording to ensure there is ample space\n\n\n\nSingle-Channel Recording\nRecorder should be set up to record on 4 channels (two attached microphones and two channel ports on the bottom of the recorder where the hydrophone is plugged in). This is useful in the event you want to narrate what is happening at the surface while the hydrophone is recording (i.e. whales breaching at this time). Follow these steps to change to single channel recording, to only record with the hydrophone, not the attached microphones. (Follow steps and picture below)\n\nClick menu button on right side of Handy Recorder\nUse scroll wheel to go to Mode option and press scroll button in to select Mode\nUse scroll button to move to Stereo (single channel) and push scroll button in to select it \nRecorder screen should return to main screen and STEREO light indicator should be on\n\nPress the 1 button on bottom left of recorder, and channel 1 & 2 light indicators should turn on (may be on already) \n\nEnsure mic button is not lit up \n\nRecorder is now ready to record with only the hydrophone on channel 1\n\n\n\nSetting the Date and Time\nThe date/time should be correctly set. If it is not, complete these steps to check the date/time and correct it.\n\nPress Menu button on left side of the recorder\nUse scroll wheel on left side of recorder to navigate to SYSTEM, press scroll wheel in to select\nSelect DATE/TIME and press scroll wheel\nUse the scroll wheel to set the year, month, day, and time\nSelect OK and press scroll wheel\n\n\n\nUsing Stamina Mode\nIf you are anticipating that battery levels will be a concern while in the field, you can switch to stamina mode to conserve power. \n\nOn the back of the recorder, open the battery compartment and switch to stamina mode on\n\nThis will lengthen the battery life to roughly 11 hours depending on usage. When using this mode, the recorder can only record/playback in WAV 44.1kHz/16-bit and MP43 formats. This may limit some recorder function, see manual for more information.\n\n\n\n\nChanging the Folder Location\nYou can manually select which folder you would like the recorder to save files to. It will default to Folder 1 (1 out of 10), and will save a new file for each recording. To change the file, follow these steps;\n\nPress the menu button on right side of the recorder\nUse scroll wheel to select folder\nChoose which folder you want to store your recordings in and push down on the scroll wheel to select\n\nWhen you are done recording, you can move the files out of one of the preset folders, into your own folder with a more descriptive naming format."
